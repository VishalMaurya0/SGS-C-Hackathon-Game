  gateExplanations:
  - gateType: 0
    desc: "A NOT gate is like a switch that always flips whatever you give it:  If
      you put in ON (1 / True) \u2192 it gives you OFF (0 / False)  If you put in
      OFF (0 / False) \u2192 it gives you ON (1 / True). \\n Normally, if the torch
      is lit, the door should open.  But with a NOT gate, it works the opposite way: 
      If the torch is lit, the door stays closed.  If the torch is unlit, the door
      opens.                                      "
  - gateType: 1
    desc: "An AND gate is like a door that only opens if all switches are ON at the
      same time:  If both inputs are ON (1 / True) \u2192 Output is ON (1 / True) 
      If even one input is OFF (0 / False) \u2192 Output is OFF (0 / False). \\n
      Imagine there are two torches connected to a magic door:  If both torches are
      lit, the door opens.  If only one torch is lit, the door stays closed.  If
      both torches are unlit, the door stays closed.  So the AND gate is like a teamwork
      lock\u2014you need all conditions met for it to activate."
  - gateType: 2
    desc: "An OR gate is like a door that opens if at least one switch is ON:  If
      both inputs are OFF (0 / False) \u2192 Output is OFF (0 / False)  If one input
      is ON (1 / True) \u2192 Output is ON (1 / True)  If both inputs are ON (1 /
      True) \u2192 Output is still ON (1 / True). \\n Imagine there are two torches
      connected to a magic door:  If both torches are unlit, the door stays closed. 
      If either one torch is lit, the door opens.  If both torches are lit, the door
      also opens.  So the OR gate is like a backup switch\u2014as long as any condition
      is met, it will activate."
  - gateType: 3
    desc: "A NOR gate is like an OR gate that\u2019s been flipped by a NOT gate: 
      If both inputs are OFF (0 / False) \u2192 Output is ON (1 / True)  If one input
      is ON (1 / True) \u2192 Output is OFF (0 / False)  If both inputs are ON (1
      / True) \u2192 Output is OFF (0 / False).\\nImagine there are two torches connected
      to a magic door:  If both torches are unlit, the door opens.  If either torch
      is lit, the door stays closed.  If both torches are lit, the door also stays
      closed.  So the NOR gate is like a strict guardian\u2014it only allows the
      door to open when nothing is active at all."
  - gateType: 4
    desc: "An XOR gate (Exclusive OR) is like an OR gate with a twist: it only turns
      ON if exactly one input is ON.  If both inputs are OFF (0 / False) \u2192 Output
      is OFF (0 / False)  If exactly one input is ON (1 / True) \u2192 Output is
      ON (1 / True)  If both inputs are ON (1 / True) \u2192 Output is OFF (0 / False).\\nImagine
      there are two torches connected to a magic door:  If both torches are unlit,
      the door stays closed.  If only one torch is lit, the door opens.  If both
      torches are lit, the door stays closed again.  So the XOR gate is like a \u201Cone
      or the other, but not both\u201D rule\u2014it rewards you only if you light
      exactly one torch."
  - gateType: 5
    desc: "A NAND gate is like an AND gate with a NOT gate on top\u2014it gives the
      opposite result of AND.  If both inputs are ON (1 / True) \u2192 Output is
      OFF (0 / False)  If even one input is OFF (0 / False) \u2192 Output is ON (1
      / True).\\nImagine there are two torches connected to a magic door:  If both
      torches are lit, the door stays closed.  If only one torch is lit, the door
      opens.  If both torches are unlit, the door also opens.  So the NAND gate is
      like a suspicious lock\u2014it refuses to open when everything is active, but
      opens in all other cases."
